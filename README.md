# ibus-mozc-ut

This repository stores my version of PKGBUILD for building mozc with ut dictionary and ibus integration.

It is essentially the merge of the two upstream scripts at the AUR, namely [mozc-ut](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mozc-ut) and [ibus-mozc](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ibus-mozc).

I have extracted some variables to help maintainability.

## License

PKGBUILD scripts don't usually carry copyright notices or licenses in the AUR; the upstreams are no exceptions.

Moreover, it seems that PKGBUILD scripts are usually considered non-copyrightable (see, for example, [here](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=58586) and [here](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=252234)).

In any case, if any of my contributions are copyrightable, they are hereby released under the [CC0 License version 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

However, if you choose to publish a modified version of the PKGBUILD script, please follow the common etiquette of acknowledging all previous contributors (see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_submission_guidelines), in the last bullet point under section 1.1 "Rules of submission").
